Hi, I'm **Chetan Shinagari**  
This repository tracks my daily progress as I learn **Machine Learning** step-by-step.
## 📅 Progress
## Day 1
  **Numpy**
  **Topics Covered:**
- Introduction to NumPy  
- Creating and manipulating arrays  
- Array indexing and slicing  
- Mathematical and statistical operations  
- Broadcasting and reshaping arrays  
- Difference between Python lists and NumPy arrays  

**Key Learnings:**
- NumPy arrays are much faster and more memory-efficient than Python lists.  
- Learned how to perform element-wise operations and basic statistics easily.  

  **Pandas**
  **Topics Covered:**
- Introduction to Pandas  
- DataFrames and Series  
- Importing datasets (CSV, Excel)  
- Handling missing data  
- Data selection using `loc[]` and `iloc[]`  
- Filtering and sorting data  
- Basic statistics using `.describe()`, `.info()`, `.value_counts()`  

**Key Learnings:**
- Pandas helps in data cleaning and manipulation.  
- Realized how easy it is to handle missing values and explore data.
